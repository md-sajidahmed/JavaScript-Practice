// when a single line is needed to execute in an if else condition or a single data is needed to store in a variable which is got from the if else condition.........in that case we can use this ternary operation to avoid this 4 or 5 lines of if else condition.

var n = 10

// condition ? true side : false side
var ans = n % 2 === 0 ? 'Even' : 'Odd'
console.log(ans)

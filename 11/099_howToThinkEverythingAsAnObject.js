// Everything which takes multiple properties to describe is an object.

/* Like to describe a person, many properties are needed. Such as:
            i)      name
            ii)     status
            iii)    education
            iv)     body shape
            v)      address
*/

/* Even a number can be an object. Like: 45.000 is a number where it has many properties to check. Such as:
            i)      integer
            ii)     floating part
            iii)    positive or negative
            iv)     string value of number

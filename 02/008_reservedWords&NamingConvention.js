// There are some words which we can't use as name of the variables in js code. Those words are known as reserved words.like:
var name = Sajid

// Here the variable name is cut by default & the note shows "name word is deprecated"
console.log(name + 'fears Allah')

// Here JS code is not taking the word 'else' & also output is not shown in the console since it is a reserved word 
var else = 20
console.log(else)

// Camel-case naming convention (Standard naming form)
var mathNumber = 10
var accountNumberDetailsId = 817

console.log(accountNumberDetailsId)

// Another naming convention
var account_number_details_id = 817

console.log(account_number_details_id)
